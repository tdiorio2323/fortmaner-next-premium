## Task Assignment Rules

### Status Assignment Logic
- **To Do**: Tasks with no dependencies or where all dependencies are completed
- **Blocked**: Tasks where dependencies are not yet started (none in current plan)
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on (limit 1 per sub-agent)
- **Completed**: Tasks that have passed all acceptance criteria

### Sub-Agent Coordination
- **Daily standups**: Required for tasks with shared dependencies
- **Weekly planning**: Review upcoming sprint tasks and blockers
- **Code reviews**: All tasks require review from another sub-agent
- **Testing handoff**: Dev tasks must pass to QA-Engineer before completion

### Change Management
- **Scope changes**: Require PRD update and effort re-estimation
- **Priority changes**: Must maintain critical path dependencies
- **Resource changes**: Require task reassignment and timeline update
- **Dependency changes**: Must update task status and scheduling
