    "body": "Fort Maner pulled up to the West End with a simple goal—give the kids a day that felt like theirs. We brought rails, a few portable boxes, and a stack of helmets so everyone could roll safely. By noon the block was buzzing: boards snapping on concrete, parents cheering from lawn chairs, and that unmistakable Chicago energy in the air.\n\nOur team ran a free skills clinic for first-timers—pushing, turning, and how to fall safely—while the older skaters helped coach. The mini-jam turned into a neighborhood showcase, with kids landing their first kickturns and locals throwing down lines they’d been practicing all summer. We handed out water, slices, stickers, and tees so everyone left with something.\n\nCommunity always comes first for us. Events like this aren’t about selling anything—they’re about showing up, listening, and investing in the young people who make this city move. The West End crew reminded us why we started Fort Maner in the first place: to build something strong, local, and real.\n\nThis is just the start. We’re planning quarterly skate days, more free helmets, and a board-recycling drop so used decks and trucks get a second life with kids who need them. If you want to volunteer, coach, or donate lightly used gear, reach out—let’s keep the momentum rolling.\n\nSkate safe, look out for each other, and we’ll see you at the next jam."
