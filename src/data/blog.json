    "date": "2025-08-19",
    "excerpt": "Boards hit the pavement as Fort Maner linked with the West End kids for an all-day skate session. From first-time riders to local rippers, the block turned into a skate park with rails, ramps, and music. Parents pulled up with lawn chairs, kids laced up with helmets, and the energy was pure Chicago — loud, supportive, and full of style. Fort Maner handed out water, stickers, and tees, making sure everyone left with something fresh. The highlight? A mini-contest that had the crowd on its feet, with young skaters pulling off tricks for prizes and bragging rights. Fort Maner’s mission stays rooted: building culture, supporting community, and giving the next generation a place to shine.",
